Your task is to update the main CLAUDE.md file at the root of this project. Execute the following
steps in order:

1. Read the existing CLAUDE.md to understand its current state.
2. Analyze the codebase to determine what technologies are used, and the general architecture of the project.
3. Determine if there is any dift between the codebase and the CLAUDE.md file.
4. Ask clarifying questions, one at a time, until you reach 95% confidence that you have an accurate understanding of the codebase and its architecture.
5. Update the CLAUDE.md file to be aligned with your understanding of the codebase and its architecture.
